A Chef cookbook for a Unicorn Tears workstation.

This is a wrapper (or application) cookbook and is therefore good and
opinionated about application and configuration defaults. Feel free to try it,
fork and modify it, or just read and learn.

## Usage

Include `recipe[ut_workstation]` in your run-list and set up some data
bag items (namely under `workstation` and `users`) to drive the cookbook.

## Requirements

* Chef 12 or higher
